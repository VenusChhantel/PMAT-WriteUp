- The sample will reach to its C2 to request and download some file.
- The sample will create some process, most likely to execute the downloaded file.
- The sample will terminate process, most likely itself when it cannot reach the C2.

Then the strings were checked using the FLOSS tool with the command:

`floss.exe Malware.Unknown.ex`

The interesting strings found were:

    C:\Users\Matt\source\repos\HuskyHacks\PMAT-maldev\src\DownloadFromURL\Release\DownloadFromURL.pdb
    cmd.exe /C ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & Del /f /q "%s"

    ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & C:\Users\Public\Documents\CR433101.dat.exe
    open

- Some interesting commands as well as URL were found in the strings.
